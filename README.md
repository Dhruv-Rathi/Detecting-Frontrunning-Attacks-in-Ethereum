# Detecting-Frontrunning-Attacks-in-Ethereum

This repository contains my work for B. Tech. Project - 2 at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur on the topic Detecting Frontrunning Attacks in Ethereum transactions.

- You can check data used for the classification task of suppression attacks here: [Classification Data](https://github.com/Dhruv-Rathi/Detecting-Frontrunning-Attacks-in-Ethereum/tree/main/Classification%20Data)

- To create more such data for displacement and insertion attacks I used this code: [Create Data](https://github.com/Dhruv-Rathi/Detecting-Frontrunning-Attacks-in-Ethereum/blob/main/Code/Creating_Data.ipynb)

- The code for training the gas price prediction model is present here: [Prediction Model](https://github.com/Dhruv-Rathi/Detecting-Frontrunning-Attacks-in-Ethereum/blob/main/Code/LSTM_model_training.ipynb)

- The code for classifying different types of attacks using multiple classification models is present here: [Displacement Attacks](https://github.com/Dhruv-Rathi/Detecting-Frontrunning-Attacks-in-Ethereum/blob/main/Code/disp_attacks.ipynb) | [Insertion Attacks](https://github.com/Dhruv-Rathi/Detecting-Frontrunning-Attacks-in-Ethereum/blob/main/Code/Insertion_attacks.ipynb) | [Suppression Attacks](https://github.com/Dhruv-Rathi/Detecting-Frontrunning-Attacks-in-Ethereum/blob/main/Code/supress_attacks.ipynb)

- The images for various results can be found in this folder [Images](https://github.com/Dhruv-Rathi/Detecting-Frontrunning-Attacks-in-Ethereum/tree/main/Images) and my report and presentation is here: [Report and PPT](https://github.com/Dhruv-Rathi/Detecting-Frontrunning-Attacks-in-Ethereum/tree/main/Report)
